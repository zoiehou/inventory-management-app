# Inventory Management App

A modern, full-stack Inventory Management System built with FastAPI, Streamlit, and PostgreSQL, containerized with Docker for seamless deployment.

Originally developed as part of a technical assessment, this project evolved into a showcase of clean backend design, database modeling, and user-friendly UI integration — demonstrating practical full-stack engineering skills.


## Highlights
- FastAPI Backend — RESTful API with SQLAlchemy ORM, robust CRUD operations, and data validation via Pydantic.
- Streamlit Frontend — intuitive dashboard for interacting with the database and visualizing parts, locations, and inventory levels.
- Duplicate Detection — intelligently identifies potential duplicate parts before insertion.
- Optimistic Locking — version control for inventory updates to prevent race conditions.
- Dockerized Architecture — runs the API, database, and UI in isolated containers for easy setup.


## Tech Stack
| Layer                | Technology              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Backend**          | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy     |
| **Frontend**         | Streamlit               |
| **Database**         | PostgreSQL              |
| **Containerization** | Docker & Docker Compose |
| **Migrations**       | Alembic                 |
| **Language**         | Python 3.11+            |


## Project Overview

The app helps small to medium teams track and manage inventory efficiently by organizing:

- Parts (with manufacturer, supplier, category, etc.)
- Storage Locations
- Inventory Quantities (by part and location)

It supports:

- Adding new parts while checking for duplicates
- Viewing all records in dynamic Streamlit tables
- Updating quantities safely with version tracking
- Modular API endpoints ready for integration with external systems
